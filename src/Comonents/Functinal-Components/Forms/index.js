//forms:to collect the user information generally use the collect the information
//as a html same bt react forms as a diffrent funcionality and syntax as same 
  //to use the forms:---input,textarea,select  
//input--- type= "text","password","file","radio"

//Genarally we have two types of components  while dealing with forms 
//1. uncontrolled components 
    //---in uncontrolled components ,state will not be controlled by react, but will be in dom control
//--- field validations were not possible

//----form validations will be possible--entire thing


//2. controlled components

//-- controlled componets will comes n react while working with forms 
//-- in controlled components, state control will be in react hands  
//-- so field validations are possible and form validations are possible 

//USEREF:Useref is a hook which creates the refrences to the "dom", and persists the values b/w the renders
//dom reference:   focus of the input

//useref has a  current property ,we can focus the input or we can persists the values b/w renders  
//useref will not create any re-render to the component, so fields validations were restricted
